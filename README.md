old-newtab
==========

This project is intended to replace Google Chrome's new tab page.

The change of Google Chrome's new tab is introduced before several versions, but Google removed the old new tab page in Chrome M33. 

This extension provides a new tab page like before M33. Thumbnail of page is temporarily unavailiable, since Chrome does not allow extension using chrome://thumb.

Still under development.
